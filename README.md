# üåç Calendar System for Terra Celestia

The **Calendar System** is a fictional timekeeping system featuring six distinct planetary calendars: **Ignis, Pyros, Eos, Astraea, Cryon, and Glacius**. Each calendar has its own unique structure, including different year lengths and weekly cycles.

| Eos      | 6            | 30            | 5.0            | 12            | 360         | 60.0               |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Weeks Calculation**  
   - Weeks in a month = `Days in a Month √∑ Days in a Week`  
   - Example (Ignis): `30 √∑ 6 = 5 weeks`

2. **Days in a Year Calculation**  
   - Days in a year = `Months in a Year √ó Days in a Month`  
   - Example (Pyros): `8 √ó 30 = 240 days`

3. **Total Weeks in a Year Calculation**  
   - Total weeks in a year = `Days in a Year √∑ Days in a Week`  
   - Example (Eos): `360 √∑ 6 = 60 weeks`
